<h1><center>About Us<center></h1>

<p style="font-family:verdana;">We are a team of dedicated and hardworking engineers who had gone through almost all the problems which a student faces generally while completing their higher education in our country. So we have a vision to help fellow students and upcoming students who may be opting for higher education. And if we are successful in helping even a single student we'll find our endeavour were not in vain. </p>

<h1><center>Vision and Goal<center></h1>

<p style="font-family:verdana;">It is very hard to cope up with the difficulties that come in front of us while going through our higher education, first one we face is what curriculum or field to choose, what university to opt, what college to opt and many more. But one of the biggest problem we face is the language barrier, as coming from rural setting and even through state boards most of the students are not very comfortable with English language which is the most preferred language for higher education. So despite of being an excellent student they end up doing mediocre. We have a vision to solve these little problems, and help improve the standard of our higher education in our country.
